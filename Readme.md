## **Introduction**

This project aims to automate the provisioning and configuration of a cloud-based monitoring stack using modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configuration management tools. It leverages Terraform to provision resources on the cloud, Ansible to configure the instances, and Jenkins to orchestrate the entire pipeline in a repeatable and auditable manner.

---

## **Problem Statement**

In dynamic infrastructure environments, manual setup of monitoring tools can be error-prone, time-consuming, and inconsistent across environments. This project solves the following:

* Automating the provisioning of infrastructure across cloud environments.
* Ensuring consistent and idempotent configuration of monitoring tools.
* Creating a CI/CD pipeline for seamless deployment.
* Eliminating manual post-provisioning steps.

---

## **Toolchain and Approach**

This project integrates three core tools to deliver end-to-end infrastructure automation and monitoring setup:

### 1. **Terraform**

Terraform is used for infrastructure provisioning in a cloud environment. It automates the creation of:

* Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)
* Public subnets
* Security groups with appropriate ingress rules
* Compute instances across multiple availability zones

State management is handled through a remote backend, enabling version-controlled and collaborative infrastructure workflows.

### 2. **Ansible**

Ansible handles post-provisioning configuration using a modular role-based structure. It automates the installation and configuration of:

* Prometheus for metric collection
* Node Exporter for exposing system metrics
* Alertmanager for notification handling

Templates and variables are leveraged to dynamically adapt configurations to the deployed environment.

### 3. **Jenkins**

Jenkins orchestrates the entire workflow through a declarative pipeline that:

* Initializes and validates infrastructure definitions
* Applies or destroys infrastructure based on user input
* Executes configuration management post-deployment
* Sends real-time email notifications on pipeline events

Credential management and secret injection are handled securely through Jenkinsâ€™ credentials binding system.

## **High-Level Architecture**

The solution is architected to deliver a lightweight, cloud-native monitoring stack. Key components include:

* **Compute Layer**: Two EC2-like instances distributed across different subnets to simulate a multi-host environment.
* **Monitoring Stack**:

  * One instance acts as the monitoring node hosting Prometheus and Alertmanager.
  * The other serves as a target node with Node Exporter installed.
* **Prometheus Configuration**: Dynamically generated to reflect the actual IPs of the deployed instances, ensuring accurate target scraping.
* **Alertmanager**: Configured to trigger basic alerts, integrating with SMTP for email notifications.
* **CI-Driven Deployment**: All provisioning and configuration is executed through a CI pipeline, supporting repeatability, traceability, and minimal manual intervention.

The architecture is modular and scalable, supporting easy extension for multi-node or HA setups.
---

## **CI/CD Pipeline Flow**

The Jenkins pipeline follows these high-level stages:

1. **Terraform Initialization and Validation**

   * Initializes modules and validates configurations.

2. **Plan and Approval**

   * Generates a plan and awaits user approval to apply or destroy infrastructure.

3. **Apply or Destroy**

   * Based on user input, infrastructure is either provisioned or cleaned up.

4. **Configuration Management**

   * Ansible is invoked post-apply to configure all deployed instances.
   * Ensures monitoring stack is fully operational post-deployment.

5. **Notification**

   * Email notifications are sent at every pipeline stage (success/failure/aborted) to relevant stakeholders.

---

## **Deployment Strategy**

* Infrastructure provisioning is completely automated and idempotent.
* Configuration is split using role-based playbooks for better reusability and modular design.
* Parameterized inputs are used for region, keys, credentials, and SMTP configurations to avoid hardcoded values.
* A delay is intentionally added post-infrastructure creation to ensure instance readiness before provisioning.
* The pipeline is generic and supports expansion into multi-region or HA deployments.
